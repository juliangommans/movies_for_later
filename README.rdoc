# Movies for Later

This is an app for searching for movies and saving them to a list which can later be checked of after seeing them. If you're like me and think of movies you want to see one day, and then forget them when you're looking for a movie to watch later.. then this is the app for you.

## Dev Notes

- This hasn't been touched in a while, certain features are broken or not working as intended
- Looking to improve flow, handle the backend better and improve visual responsiveness
- Looking to add features such as trailers, public comment threads on movies, the ability to see overall pre/post ratings from others
- Investigate API and other movie api's to enhance experience and add features
